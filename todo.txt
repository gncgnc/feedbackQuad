encapsulate
	input transformations (somehow)
	keep a transformation matrix internally
		use applyMatrix? (it exists but says it's slow in p5 source)
* try feedback in shader
	new git branch
	can do noise offsets and such
	will be interesting with feedback  
post process fedback image
	* try postprocessing lib?
    feedback causes blur
    iterated application of internal processes gives rise to feedback character
    internal process is averaging of pixels -> blurring 
    x maybe sharpen image and see results 
	    results
	    	blur sharpen cycle produces ~~interesting~~ results
	    	buggy blur shader is beautiful with infinite zoom
interaction!
	optical flow 
		opencv? easy avg value
			https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing/blob/master/examples/OpticalFlow/OpticalFlow.pde
		pixelflow  
	knobs for rotation & scale
		use arduino and Serial lib
	audioreactive?
		beat reduces scale
		rotation should be fairly low freq
	OSC with an android device?
		could be the simplest solution
	FaceOSC
		face orientation -> rotation
		mouth height -> scale 
		would be very nice, but hogs video input :(
		need syphon (a mac)
	*** different idea ***
		* use frame diff and put it on top of feedback
		black is transparent -> does not obscure image 
		this will allow direct manipulation of fedback image
		like shining a light on the screen 
translation and rotation in 3D
	PeasyCam ?!? 
		annoying internal transformations 
	can just add a rotateY control; 2 degs of rot freedom 

////////////////// DONE //////////////////
x add margin for better interaction
x DOCUMENT results!
